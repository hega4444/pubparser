    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Neural networks are important, mainly because they are, in fact, widely used and adopted in AI research, industry, and pretty much anything that involves pattern recognition, so they are very important to understand.</li>
        <li>They have neurons and layers, much like a human brain, although they don't actually work like a human brain. This is a common misconception.</li>
        <li>We talk about applications, issues, and stuff that might be relevant but also might be just additional information to fill this paragraph.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Introduction</h3> AI is big now, and neural networks are cool. They learn from data, meaning they take input, process it, and produce some kind of meaningful output. But what does "meaningful" really mean? That depends. Unlike normal software, they just "figure things out" somehow. They do this by adjusting weights, but what are weights? They are numbers. That's it. These numbers determine how strong a connection is between artificial neurons. <b>However</b>, it's important to note that there are many different types of neural networks, and they all work slightly differently. They help with images, texts, and robots, which means they're used in self-driving cars, medical image analysis, chatbots, and many other things. But there are problems. Big ones. They require a lot of data, and if you don’t have enough, they won’t work well. Sometimes they just fail for no obvious reason.</p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>We did some things. Some important things. But let’s get into it. We used a CNN. Why? Because CNNs are good at image recognition, and that’s what we needed. It was big. Very big. Deep even. We trained it on images. But not just any images—<i>10,000 labeled images</i>. That might sound like a lot, but in the world of deep learning, it’s actually quite small.</p>
    <p>Here’s the process we followed:</p>
    <p><h5>Some important steps:</h5></p>
    <h1>- Data was used. This was crucial. Without data, training wouldn’t work. We had labeled images because supervised learning requires labels.</h1>
    <h3>- Training happened. This means we ran many iterations, tweaking parameters, adjusting learning rates, and hoping for the best.</h3>
    <h6>- Results were seen. Eventually, the model produced something. Was it good? We’ll see in the next section.</h6>

    <h5>Results</h5>
    <p>The model got a number. The number was good. But how good? It depends on how you define "good." In this case, we got 92% accuracy, which is higher than some models but lower than others. However, accuracy isn’t everything! We also looked at loss. What is loss? It’s a number that tells us how bad the model is doing. Lower is better.</p>
    <p>We compared our results to other models, such as decision trees and support vector machines (SVMs), and found that deep learning performed better. But why? Because it’s better at capturing complex patterns. However, deeper networks came with a cost: they took longer to train. A lot longer. We also found that dropout regularization was necessary to prevent overfitting. Overfitting is when a model memorizes the data instead of generalizing from it. That’s bad. Really bad.</p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>Neural networks are fascinating but tricky. They require a lot of computation, and sometimes they just don’t work well. There’s also the issue of bias. If you train on biased data, your model will be biased too. Garbage in, garbage out.</p>
    <p>Also, interpretability is a big challenge. People say neural networks are black boxes, and they are. Nobody really knows what’s happening inside. Sure, we can visualize some layers, but do we really understand why they make certain decisions? Not really.</p>
    <p>Hyperparameter tuning is another issue. You have learning rates, batch sizes, number of layers, activation functions—so many things to tweak. If you get one wrong, your model performs terribly. Finding the right combination is an art. Or just brute force.</p>

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Neural networks are powerful but mysterious. They need big computers. People will probably improve them. Also, AI ethics are important. We should think about bias, fairness, and other social impacts. AI will keep evolving, and we’ll need better techniques to understand and control it.</p>

    <h6>Future Work</h6>
    <p>We should try other architectures. Maybe transformers. Maybe reinforcement learning. Who knows? The field is changing fast, and there’s always something new.</p>
    <p>Also, interpretability needs more research. If we can understand these models better, we can trust them more.</p>
