- Parse complex publication metadata
- Identify author networks and collaborations
- Extract citation graphs and reference networks
- Generate clean JSON output
- Support for multiple academic publisher formats
- Intelligent entity recognition
- Robust error handling

## 📋 Requirements

Install all required dependencies using:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/academic-graph-extractor.git
    cd academic-graph-extractor

2. Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure your environment variables:

    cp .env.example .env

## 🎯 Usage

Basic usage example:

    from parser import HTMLParser
    from graph import PublicationGraph

    # Initialize parser
    parser = HTMLParser()

    # Parse academic HTML document
    publication_data = parser.parse("path/to/paper.html")

    # Get structured JSON output
    json_output = publication_data.to_json()

    # Analyze citation network
    citations = publication_data.get_citations()
    authors = publication_data.get_authors()

## 🔧 Configuration

You can customize the parser behavior by modifying `config.py`:

    PARSER_CONFIG = {
        "extract_references": True,
        "extract_citations": True,
        "extract_authors": True,
        "detect_institutions": True,
        "output_format": "json"
    }
